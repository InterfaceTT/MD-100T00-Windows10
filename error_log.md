### Windows 10

#### Lab 0601 - Sideloading an app lab fails because the certficate has expired.

*Jan 05 21*: The certificate used for sideloading apps expired on Dec 30th. We are looking into how we can quickly update this lab with a new certificate.  However, do note that new labs will be launched in February 2021, and this partiicular lab is being retired.  We will post any updates to this here.  Thanks for your understanding. 

#### Lab 0101 - [RESOLVED] Unable to perform the Windows upgrade lab due to the Windows 7 VM not activated.
*Apr 14 20*: Lab hosters should be providing an activated Windows 7 VM when provisioning for students. 
If the LON-CL6 VM is not activated, please contact your lab hoster for assistance.
